# STUDENT-PROGRESS-TRACKER-SYSTEM-
*Project Overview
The Student Progress Tracker System is a Python console-based application that collects student details and subject marks, calculates total and average marks, assigns grades, checks failed subjects, and displays a detailed student report card.
The project also includes a menu-driven system that allows users to view total marks, average marks, or the report card again without re-entering data.
 *Objectives
Collect student personal and academic details
Calculate total and average marks
Identify failed subjects
Assign grades based on performance
Display a formatted student report card
Provide a menu system for easy navigation
 *Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Concepts Used:
Input / Output
Loops (for, while)
Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
Lists
Menu-driven program logic
*Features
Enter student name, class, roll number
Enter marks for multiple subjects
Automatic calculation of:
Total marks
Average marks
Grade
Identifies failed subjects (marks < 35)
Displays student report card
Menu options to:
View total marks
View average marks
View report card again
Exit the program
